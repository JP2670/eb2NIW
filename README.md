## üîë Setting Up OpenAI API Access

This script uses OpenAI GPT-4o model.  
You need an OpenAI API key to use it.

- Signup for free at: [https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
- After signup, go to [API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Click **Create New Secret Key** and copy it
- Paste your API key inside the Python script here:

```python
openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"
```

**‚ö° Important:** You will need to add a small amount of balance ($5‚Äì$10) to your OpenAI account to run this full project.

Cost estimate:
- Around **$20‚Äì$23** to process ~7,800 PDFs using GPT-4o-mini model (April 2025 prices).

## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Customize For Your Own Petition

You must hardcode your own petition's strengths inside the script.  
In `process_eb2niw_prongs_compare.py`, update the following dictionary:

```python
my_case = {
    "Prong1": "Summarize why your National Importance is strong",
    "Prong2": "Summarize why you are Well Positioned",
    "Prong3": "Summarize why Labor Waiver is justified for you"
}
```

üëâ Use simple, 1-2 sentence summary for each prong based on your own EB2-NIW petition.

## üìÑ Output

The script will generate a file called `summary_prongs_comparison.csv` with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|:---|:---|
| PDF Link | Link to original AAO decision |
| Prong 1 Reason | Why Prong 1 failed for that case |
| Prong 2 Reason | Why Prong 2 failed |
| Prong 3 Reason | Why Prong 3 failed |
| Prong 1 Verdict | Your case stronger / Mixed |
| Prong 2 Verdict | Your case stronger / Mixed |
| Prong 3 Verdict | Your case stronger / Mixed |
| Final Verdict | Overall assessment: Stronger / Mixed |

## üõ† Notes

- The Master_file provided contains over 7,800 AAO decision PDF links (as of April 2025).
- Some non-EB2-NIW cases are mixed in (e.g., EB-1, EB-3) ‚Äî filtering is a future update.
- The script automatically detects non-NIW cases and marks them.
- For 'mixed' verdict cases, you can manually check the PDF links to make your own detailed judgment.
- You can even use the PDF link with ChatGPT to create deeper comparisons with your petition if needed.
